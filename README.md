Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. This project applies machine learning techniques to segment customers, helping businesses tailor their marketing strategies effectively.

🚀 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas (Data manipulation)

NumPy (Numerical computations)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

Scikit-learn (Machine learning algorithms)

Jupyter Notebook (Development environment)

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains customer information such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

Source: Publicly available datasets from platforms like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical data.

🛠 Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Segmentation-ML.git
cd Customer-Segmentation-ML

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage

Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Run the notebook Customer_Segmentation.ipynb step by step.

Adjust hyperparameters and visualize clusters.

📈 Results & Output

The project applies clustering techniques such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN.

Visualizations include scatter plots showing customer segmentation.

Insights from the clustering results help businesses identify different customer groups.
